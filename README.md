## Technologies
* [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)
* [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/)

## Usage
When the user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
When the user scrolls down
they are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
When they view the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
When the user clicks into a timeblock,
they can enter an event.
When the user clicks the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage.
And when they refresh the page, the saved events will persist.
